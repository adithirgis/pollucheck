### We are in this together!

A walk through to use this app for everyone -

How to Download Data from the CPCB website?

- Example - Where do you live in India?

- Find the nearest [CPCB station](https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/caaqm-dashboard-all/caaqm-landing) to download data from a regulatory air quality monitor.

- Visit [CPCB website](https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/caaqm-dashboard-all/caaqm-landing) to access the Central/State Pollution Control Board Data.

- Select the Indian state from the "State Name" dropdown.

![Fig 2](WWW/CPCB_Station.jpeg)

- Now select the city for which the data needs to be downloaded using the "City Name" dropdown menu.

- Now from the "Station Name" drop-down select the desired station.

- Select the Parameters.
Note- Multiple parameters can be selected at a time.

- Report Format- To use the PolluCheck app, Please keep the format as "tabular".

- Criteria- This drop-down will help you to select between different time averaging of data.
Note- Pollucheck app only supports 15 min, 30 min, and 60 min average data.

- Now select the Start Date and End date of the data and click on "Submit".
- Download that data (15, 30, 60 min resolution would be good).
- Select the source from where the data was downloaded.
- Now select the time resolution at which the data was downloaded.

- Select the check box according to your need.

   - Remove Negative values- Negative values do not represent concentration,they represent missing values, so it ie always advised to remove them.This option helps you to remove all the negative values from your entire dataset.

   - Remove consecutive repeated measurements- Sometimes when the instrument breaks down, it tends to show exactly same consecutive values, it is advised to remove these as well. This feature removes consecutive repetitive values in your dataset.

   - Remove outliers based on Mean and Std Dev-  If you want to clean your dataset based on outliers, not usually necessary, use only if you want to remove outiliers based on Mean and Standard Deviation values.

   - Completeness of data in a day- If you are looking for entire/complete dataset to be present for analysis and not less, you can use this to select the desired level of completeness in a day using the scroll bar.

- Remove PM2.5 and PM10 values above- Usually, values above 999 are incorrect, also because the instruments usually measure only to 999 values in PM instruments. This can be removed using this filter option.

- Output average- The uploaded data can be converted into daily or hourly mean values.

- "Download the csv" or click on "Show Data" to see the data in the app.

- Look at the time-series plot in Plots tab on what days it is high and at what time, look at the diurnal pattern and the general way on how air pollution varies. 
- Look at months which bother you. 
- Look for sources (which you think contribute to air pollution) and write back to us on what you see.
- What more do you want to learn? Talk to the Humans of ILK.
