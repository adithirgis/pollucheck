Description: Air pollution leads to various health hazards, hence there is a need to process 
    and effectively work with the available open-source data. pollucheck helps 
    to analyze and visualize open-source air pollution data available. An example 
    data set is already loaded to help you walk through all the features of the 
    app. If you need help with downloading your own, check the README file on GitHub. 
    This app can process all parameters except wind direction which when downloaded at
    1 hour is processed correctly. Wind direction at any other time resolution 
    (e.g. - daily average) is not averaged correctly as it is a vector and 
    cannot be averaged using simple arithmetic mean.
