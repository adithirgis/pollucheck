Description: This app helps to analyze and visualize open-source air
    pollution data available. An example dataset is already loaded to help
    you walk through all the features of the app. If you need help with
    downloading your own, check the README file on GitHub. This app can
    process all parameters except wind direction which when downloaded at
    1 hour is processed correctly. Wind direction at any other time resolution 
    (e.g. - daily average) is not averaged correctly as it is a vector and 
    cannot be averaged using simple arithmetic mean.
