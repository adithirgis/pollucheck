# pollucheck: Open Source Air Quality App!

PolluCheck helps exploring the open source Indian air quality data.

âš¡ Fun fact: Its a tidy code!

The link for this app is this - <https://aruapps.shinyapps.io/OpenSourceAirQualityApp/>.

-   PolluCheck (currently in the development phase) is specific to India, and allows users to handle open-source air-quality datasets available from OpenAQ (<https://openaq.org/#/countries/IN?_k=5ecycz>), CPCB (<https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/caaqm-dashboard-all/caaqm-landing>), and AirNow (<https://www.airnow.gov/international/us-embassies-and-consulates/#India>).
-   Users can visualize data, analyse data, perform basic statistical operations, and generate a variety of publication-ready plots.
-   We have also included the popular openair package in this application.

# Have a look at the app!

### We are in this together!

A walk through to use this app for everyone -

#### How to download data from the CPCB website?

-   Example - Where do you live in India?

-   Find the nearest [CPCB station](https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/caaqm-dashboard-all/caaqm-landing) to download data from a regulatory air quality monitor.

-   Visit [CPCB website](https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/caaqm-dashboard-all/caaqm-landing) to access the Central/State Pollution Control Board Data.

![](inst/shiny/WWW/CPCB_Station.jpeg)

-   Now select the city for which the data needs to be downloaded using the "City Name" dropdown menu.

![](inst/shiny/WWW/CPCB_Station_city.jpeg)

-   Now from the "Station Name" drop-down select the desired station.

-   Select the Parameters. Note- Multiple parameters can be selected at a time.

![](inst/shiny/WWW/CPCB_Station_parameters.jpeg)

-   Report Format- To use the PolluCheck app, Please keep the format as "tabular".

-   Criteria- This drop-down will help you to select between different time averaging of data. Note- Pollucheck app only supports 15 min, 30 min, and 60 min average data.

-   Select the Start Date and End date of the data and click on "Submit".

-   Download that data (15, 30, 60 min resolution would be good).

### Have a look at the app usage

-   Select the source from where the data was downloaded.
-   Now select the time resolution at which the data was downloaded.

<img src="inst/shiny/WWW/image_1.JPG" width="315"/>

-   Select the check box according to your need.

    -   Remove Negative values- Negative values do not represent concentration,they represent missing values, so it is always advised to remove them.This option helps you to remove all the negative values from your entire dataset.

    -   Remove duplicate consecutive values- Sometimes when the instrument breaks down, it tends to show exactly same consecutive values, it is advised to remove these as well. This feature removes consecutive repetitive values in your dataset.

    -   Specify a multiple (X) to remove outliers based on Mean and SD- If you want to clean your dataset based on outliers, not usually necessary, use only if you want to remove outiliers based on Mean and Standard Deviation values.

    -   Specify % of data completeness for computing daily mean values- If you are looking for entire/complete dataset to be present for analysis and not less, you can use this to select the desired level of completeness in a day using the scroll bar.

    -   Remove PM2.5 and PM10 above- Usually, values above 9999 are incorrect, also because the instruments usually measure only to 999 values in PM instruments. This can be removed using this filter option.

    <img src="inst/shiny/WWW/image_2.JPG" width="410"/>

-   Output aggregation- The uploaded data can be converted into daily or hourly mean values.

-   "Download as csv" or click on "Show Data" to see the data in the app.

![](inst/shiny/WWW/image_3.JPG)

-   Look at the time series of pollutant concentrations in the **Plots** tab (time series are plots with x axis representing time). Do you see patterns? Are there times of the month or times of the day where concentrations are particularly higher or lower? Are there particular months in a year that are more polluted than others?
-   Think about sources in the particular location: traffic, industries, garbage burning, etc.

-   Trend Analysis is also available for daily values. For trend analysis using Mann-Kendall test we use [mk.test](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/trend/versions/1.1.4/topics/mk.test). For imputing values in the discontinuous data set we use [forecast package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/forecast/forecast.pdf). For continuous wavelet transform we use [biwavelet package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/biwavelet/biwavelet.pdf). In periodicity analysis, the contours covered by black lines represent the significant periodicity at 95% significant 519 level.\\
