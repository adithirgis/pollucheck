- PolluCheck (currently in the development phase) is specific to India, and allows users to handle open-source air-quality datasets available from OpenAQ (https://openaq.org/#/countries/IN?_k=5ecycz), CPCB (https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/caaqm-dashboard-all/caaqm-landing), and AirNow (https://www.airnow.gov/international/us-embassies-and-consulates/#India). 
- Users can visualize data, analyse data, perform basic statistical operations, and generate a variety of publication-ready plots. 
- We have also included the popular openair package in this application.
